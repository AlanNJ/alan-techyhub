            <h2>Welcome To My <br>Techy World</h2>
            <p>I am a 20 year old guy from a beautiful country called Nepal.
                I am currently staying in AP India for my Bachelor level education and studying Artificial Intelligence and Data Science Engineering(CAD) on BBC Engineering College Odalarevu.
                I am a self tought programmer who spent half of time doing mistakes only and thats why I feel that it helped me to groom myself out.
                If you want to be related with me then stay tuned with me for some awesome blogs.

        <p>Playing with computers was my biggest passion since my childhood. I started my journey when I was in class 11.As a self taught programmer,<br>I had to face a lot of difficulties:for most of the times I had been doing stuffs which were worthless or they don't increase your skill-set enough to get mentally prepared for the real world suffs.
            Yeah you,yes you the person right in front  of the screen,<br>I know you have been also suffering from these anxieties that I had faced but that's how everything works especially while doing things on our own but this will definitely grow as a person.
            From now I'll be sharing my tech journey and a lot of stuffs related to technology,<br>programming and other more related stuffs through blogs in this website and will also be doing some cool stuffs in the coming days.
            Stay Safe !! Stay Tuned
